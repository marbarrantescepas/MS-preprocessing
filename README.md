# Structural MRI Preprocessing Pipeline for Multiple Sclerosis
This pipeline is designed for structural MRI preprocessing specifically for studies related to Multiple Sclerosis (MS). It includes several preprocessing steps to automatically segment and fill MS lesions, as well as, to perform FreeSurfer preprocessing and quality check (QC) for each step.

## Overview: 

1. Previous to lesion segmentation:
2. Lesion segmentation:
3. Quality Check lesion segmentation:
4. Lesion filling:
5. Quality Check lesion filling:
6. FreeSurfer cross-sectionally:
7. Quality Check FreeSurfer:
